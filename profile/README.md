# What is Arweave and AO?

[Arweave](https://arweave.org) is a decentralized permanent data storage network.

Recently, Arweave announced the release of a hyper threaded computer called [AO](https://ao.arweave.dev).

This is a big step forward for the Arweave Ecosystem and web3 in general as it will enable developers to build hyper scalable smart contracts and DAPPs that was not feasible before.
